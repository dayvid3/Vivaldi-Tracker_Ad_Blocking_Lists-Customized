### 1.0 (02-25-2024)

* Initial release

### 1.1 (03-19-2024)

* I've swapped out the custom ad blocking source [OISD](https://big.oisd.nl/) for [Hagezi's Pro DNS Blocklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/adblock/pro.txt). It's another big list. Opinions suggest that it is more reliable, effective, and curated more discerningly.

* More information about the Hagezi lists can be found at [Hagezi's GitHub](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/blob/main/README.md)

* So far, I've found the Multi PRO version to be the most effective. There is a Pro++ and an Ultimate version, but I've found that even just going up to the Pro++ version causes major response issues. There were other random sites with an extreme slowdown, but Google Apps sites such as Drive and Docs are an example. It could be a combination of lists or other factors, but the Pro version is what I'd recommend.

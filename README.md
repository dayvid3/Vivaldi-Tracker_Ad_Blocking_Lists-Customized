# Vivaldi: Tracker / Ad Blocking Lists (Customized)
This is the current collection of Tracker and Ad Blocking sources that I am using with Vivaldi's native ad blocker, to enhance its effectiveness. I’ve tried to minimize sources with overlapping rules.

Vivaldi’s [Block Trackers and Ads](https://help.vivaldi.com/desktop/privacy/tracking-and-ad-blocking/) guide can help you get started (There are mobile guides as well). Once you get to that point, below are my sources of choice.

- Disable all the **Built-In** rules except those listed below. You will then have to enable the sources that aren’t on by default.
- Manually add the **Custom** sources in their appropriate sections - Tracker Blocking or Ad Blocking
